Knesset Bill Voting System
This project is a web application that enables citizens to actively engage in the legislative process by voting on bills presented in the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament). It provides users with real-time information about ongoing legislative proposals, allows them to cast their votes, and offers insights into their political alignment based on their voting patterns.

Features
Bill Information Extraction: Utilizes a custom-built library to extract detailed information from the national legislation database.
Real-time Updates: Provides up-to-date information on bills and their status, reflecting the actual proceedings in the Knesset.
User Voting System: Allows citizens to vote on proposed bills, contributing to a simulated representation of public opinion.
Party Suitability Assessment: Analyzes user voting patterns to suggest the political party that aligns most closely with their preferences.
Interactive Graphs: Presents graphical representations of voting results to visualize the stance of citizens on each bill.
Tech Stack
Python Flask: Used to externalize information extracted from the legislation database.
Node.js Server: Manages user requests and handles the backend functionality.
React Client: Provides the frontend interface for users to interact with the system.
Data Visualization: Utilizes libraries for creating graphs and visual representations of voting outcomes.
How to Use
To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies for both the client and server.
Run the Node.js server to handle backend requests.
